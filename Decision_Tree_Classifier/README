Hi!!
This Project comprises of code for Decision tree classifier (self-written as well as SK Learns inbuit algorithm).
The dataset used for the project is IRIS Dataset.
    About Dataet: 1. The dataset comprises of 4 features : Sepal length , Sepal width , Petal Length , Petal Width
                  2. These features are used as independent features inorder to classify the flowers as Setosa , Virginica and Versicolor
                  3. To work upon this dataset , I have written custom made decision tree classifier of my own.
                  
The project also shows the usage of SK Learn's inbulit Decision tree classifer over the OR Dataset.
At last , Visuals have been created to understand the trained model.
